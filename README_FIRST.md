## Welcome to the Notes Repository

This repository contains comprehensive study notes on Java Collections Framework and Spring Boot, organized in a hierarchical structure with consistent formatting.

## Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Using the Python Launcher (Recommended)

1. **Run the Notes Launcher application**
   - Execute `python notes_launcher.py` in your command line/terminal
   - This provides a user-friendly interface with navigation and update features
   - Choose a topic to view or use the options at the bottom

2. **Alternatively, use the simple viewer**
   - Execute `python view_notes.py` to open the main home page
   - Or specify a file: `python view_notes.py Spring Boot/Home.md`

### Option 2: Direct Browsing

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   - This shows the main home page with navigation to all topics
   - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari are recommended

2. **View Markdown files directly**
   - All content is in Markdown (.md) format
   - For the best experience, install a Markdown viewer extension:
     - [Markdown Reader for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-reader/medapdbncneneejhbgcjceippjlfkmkg)
     - Or use an editor with Markdown preview (VS Code, Atom, etc.)

## Features

- **Auto-Update System**: Check for and apply updates with one click
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Main home page links to topic-specific home pages
- **Consistent Formatting**: All notes follow a standardized format for better readability
- **Navigation Links**: Each document includes navigation links at the top and bottom

## Content Overview

- **Java Collections Framework**
  - Collection types and implementations
  - Java Cursors (Iterators)
  - Performance characteristics

- **Spring Boot**
  - Core features and concepts
  - Comparison with traditional Spring
  - Application architecture

## Requirements for Python Launcher
