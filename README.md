## How to Use

1. Start at the [Home Page](Home.md) to navigate to specific topics
2. Each topic has its own home page with links to all documents in that topic
3. Use the navigation links at the top and bottom of each page to move between documents

## Auto-Update System

This repository includes an automatic update system that keeps cloned repositories in sync with the main repository. Here's how it works:

1. When a user opens the Home page through `index.html`, the system checks for updates
2. If updates are available, the user is prompted to update
3. Upon confirmation, the system automatically pulls the latest versions of all files
4. The page reloads with the updated content
