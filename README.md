# Notes Repository

A comprehensive, organized collection of study notes on various technical topics.

## Overview

This repository contains structured study notes on various technical topics, organized in a hierarchical system with consistent formatting and navigation. The first topic covered is the Java Collections Framework.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Main home page links to topic-specific home pages, which in turn link to detailed notes
- **Consistent Formatting**: All notes follow standardized formatting for better readability
- **Navigation System**: Each document includes consistent navigation links at the top and bottom
- **Auto-Update System**: Repository automatically checks for updates when users access the home page

## Topics Covered

- **Java Collections Framework**
  - List implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack)
  - Set implementations
  - Utility classes (Arrays)
  - Java Cursors (Enumeration, Iterator, ListIterator)

## How to Use

1. Start at the [Home Page](Home.md) to navigate to specific topics
2. Each topic has its own home page with links to all documents in that topic
3. Use the navigation links at the top and bottom of each page to move between documents

## Auto-Update System

This repository includes an automatic update system that keeps cloned repositories in sync with the main repository. Here's how it works:

1. When a user opens the Home page through `index.html`, the system checks for updates
2. If updates are available, the user is prompted to update
3. Upon confirmation, the system automatically pulls the latest versions of all files
4. The page reloads with the updated content

### For Contributors

To set up the auto-update system in your cloned repository:

1. Serve the repository through a local web server (required for service workers)
2. Open the repository using the `index.html` file rather than directly accessing the markdown files
3. Updates will be checked automatically every 24 hours

## Future Plans

1. Add more topics (Java Core, Design Patterns, Data Structures, etc.)
2. Implement automatic cross-referencing between related topics
3. Add diagrams and visualizations
4. Develop a search functionality
